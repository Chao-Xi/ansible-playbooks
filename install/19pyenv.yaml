##Ansible install ansible virtualenv for itself
#Pyenv is a bash extension - will not work on Windows - 
#that intercepts your calls to python, pip, etc., to direct them to one of several of the system python tool-chains. 
#So you always have all the libraries that you have installed in the selected python version available - 
#as such it is good for users who have to switch between different versions of python.

#pyenv-virtualenv is one plugin of pyenv

#VirtualEnv, is pure python so works everywhere, it makes a copy of, optionally a specific version of, 
#python and pip local to the activate environment which may or may not include links to the current system tool-chain, i
#if it does not you can install just a known subset of libraries into that environment.
